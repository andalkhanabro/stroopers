# PMS: 2D Planetary Motion Simulator
### *Understanding the universe, one simulation at a time.*

The main goal of the _planetary motion simulator_ is to graphically depict a simplified system in planetary motion and aid students' learning of the physics that governs it. 
Prompted by input from the user, the application will display a system of planets in circular/elliptical motion, allowing the user to enter values for the parameters which affect 
the trajectory and see how the variables change throughout the motion. The user will be able to choose from the pre-existing planets in our solar system, in addition to any custom planets they make. Each planet will have a user-defined name, radius, mass and color. Next, the user will enter some values for 
the necessary variables of the orbiting bodies including mass, angular frequency, radius of orbit, and tangential velocity. A visualisation of the system with the entered values will then be shown on the screen. 


Having taken both first-year physics courses at **UBC**, I, along with my peers, noticed how non-intuitive rotational motion can be. At first, the idea seems almost impossible: why does a body in orbit stay in orbit? To appeal to the curiosity of such students and make the topic visually intuitive, 
PMS will simulate motion and help demystify concepts like escape velocity and the minimum centripetal force, given the necessary parameters. Since visualising motion can be hard at times, PMS can also be used by instructors and high-school teachers to demonstrate how each variable affects the motion, making the mathematics that follows as an elegant 
proof of whatever is observed. The broader goal of PMS is to make physics more accessible to people who wish to explore ideas in physics but lack in the mathematical background to do so theoretically, and in doing so, act as a motivator for further study. PMS can also be used by kids to pique their interest, introducing real phenomena of nature and the physics behind it
ahead of time.

I have, for long, wished to fuse computer science and physics in a project to help make a concept easier to understand. For me, the consistency of mathematics is beautifully exhibited in the physics of our universe, and coding PMS seems like a good idea to exhibit this visually. I believe simulators like these can cater to a lot of visual learners, and show how mathematics is natural, intuitive and has practical implications. Ultimately, I aim to scale this project so that it can be potentially used by instructors at **UBC** as a tool while teaching rotational motion and gravitation.
